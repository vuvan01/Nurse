/* IMPROVEMENT:
    - implement more test cases to cover the whole project
    - generic function for adding data to DB or combine them into 1 function
    - typealias for parameters
    - autolayout
    - implement encypt dectypt password in User NSManagedObject subclass
    - validation put in model class?
    - apply MVVM to reduce the heavy job of controllers, what about VIPER? -- Cocoa MVC is the best architectural pattern in terms of the speed of the development.
